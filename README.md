I build **production-grade platforms** with Django, scale them on **solid DevOps**, and lead teams to ship **measurable business value**. I enjoy taking complex domains (education ERP, logistics/shipping, finance) and turning them into **clear architectures** with **clean admin UX** and **automation** end-to-end.

- 🧭 **Role:** Senior Software Engineer & Engineering Manager  
- 🏗️ **Strengths:** Django, Postgres, Redis, Celery, Channels (WebSocket), NGINX/Gunicorn, Docker, S3, CI/CD  
- 🧪 **Mindset:** performance-first, pragmatic DDD, strong admin workflows, observability, documentation  
- 🧑‍🏫 **Team:** mentor/train engineers (Together Developer Academy), code reviews, onboarding playbooks

## Engineering Focus

- **Backend (Django/DRF):** domain models, lifecycle hooks (managers / django-lifecycle), admin UX, query tuning (select_related/prefetch_related), signals vs. tasks, validation boundaries.
- **Async & Real-time:** Celery (Redis/RabbitMQ), Channels for notifications, long-running jobs, idempotency & retries.
- **Data & Docs:** Postgres, migrations at scale, backup/restore strategy, data exports (PDF/Excel), audit trails.
- **Ops:** NGINX + Gunicorn/Uvicorn, Docker Compose, SSL with Certbot, DigitalOcean, S3, metrics & logs.
- **Security & Access:** 2FA/OTP, permissions, multi-tenant patterns, domain isolation.
- **DX & Quality:** CI/CD, code review culture, linting/formatting, reproducible environments.

## How I work

- **Architecture first.** Use domain maps and pseudo-schemas before code.  
- **Admin matters.** Faster/cleaner admin = faster operations & happier clients.  
- **Measure & iterate.** Profilers, SQL inspectors, and logging guide every “optimization.”  
- **Bilingual delivery.** Arabic/English UI/Docs; RTL/LTR aware.  
- **Mentor by doing.** Pair programming, actionable PR feedback, deliberate practice.
